The club was founded on 24 April 1907, as a gathering place for Cairo's Student Unions.Al Ahly has a record of 42 national league titles, 37 national cup titles and 11 national super cup titles, making them the most decorated club in Egypt. The club has never been relegated to the Egyptian Second Division. Al Ahly is considered the most successful team in Africa and is one of the continent's giants.The establishment of the club was approved and architect Ismail Seri designed the main building of the club, which was revised by Mitchell-Innes to place the building in the south-eastern corner of the land, so that the building main entrance would face north. A civil company on behalf of Al Ahly Sports Club was established. Shares of the company were worth 5EGP Pounds each, and it was the goal of the club when it was established to raise 5000 pounds. Only 3165 pounds were collected over a year, which was not enough. This forced the club to borrow 1,000 pounds from the National Bank of Egypt in March 1908 by Omar Sultan and Idris Ragheb and Talaat Harb contributed 100 pounds to the establishment of the club. The first honorary president of the club was the Minister of Education Saad Zaghloul. The name of Al Ahly Sporting Club was suggested by Amine Samy Amin, to serve the students and graduates of high schools who were the mainstay of the revolution against the British occupation.On 2 April 1908, Mitchell-Innes stepped down as president of the club. Aziz Ezzat was appointed as the new president and became the first Egyptian president of Al Ahly. The official opening ceremony of the club was held in the club's main building on 26 February 1908.Mokhtar El Tetsh, one of the club legends, the club's old stadium and current training stadium was named after himThe game of football was not one of the goals of the founders of Al Ahly club. The goal of the club was to open its doors to students of higher schools to meet and practice political dialogues. However, the graduates of high schools who were members of the club fell in love with football, which prompted Ahly to build the first stadium in 1909. They used to call it at the time (Al-Hawsh), which is a colloquial word from the Egyptian dialect which means the courtyard in Arabic. The stadium was developed over the years to be Mokhtar El-Tetsh Stadium.";
